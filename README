The OER Bookmarking System.

This project has been funded by JISC and the lead partners are Newcastle 
University.  We are building a bookmarking system specifically for recording 
Open Educational Resources (OER).

The system is built using Django version 1.3.

PREREQUISITES -

You will need to install the following Django apps for this to work - 

1. Django-social-auth (https://github.com/omab/django-social-auth)
2. Django-tagging (http://code.google.com/p/django-tagging/)
3. Django-ajax-selects (http://code.google.com/p/django-ajax-selects/)
4. Django-tagging-autocomple (http://code.google.com/p/django-tagging-autocomplete/)
5. Django-haystack (http://haystacksearch.org/) * 
6. Django-tastypie (https://github.com/toastdriven/django-tastypie)

We are using the following Javascript libraries

1. JQuery (http://jquery.com)
2. JQuery UI - mainly for the themeroller (http://jqueryui.com) and autocomplete
3. DataTables (http://datatables.net)
4. JQuery plugin: Autocomplete (http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-autocomplete/)

The Menu navigation was taken from 
http://www.sohtanaka.com/web-design/examples/drop-down-menu/

We are also using a couple of icons from the Fugue icon set 
(http://p.yusukekamiyamane.com/icons/search/fugue/), which is licensed under a

* django haystack can be customised to used several search backends.
This system is setup as default to use Whoosh (http://whoosh.ca/) which is include in django haystack, to 
change this see the haystack documentation (http://docs.haystacksearch.org/dev/tutorial.html#configuration) 
Notes: 	1.) In settings.py HAYSTACK_WHOOSH_PATH must point to a file location on your server.
		2.) 'python manage.py rebuild_index' must be run as a cronjob on a regular basis to update the search index
